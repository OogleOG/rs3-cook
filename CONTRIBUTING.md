## üìù Coding Standards

### Java Code Style
- **Use Java 17+ features** appropriately
- **Follow standard naming conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Add JavaDoc** for public methods and classes
- **Keep methods focused** and reasonably sized
- **Use meaningful variable names**

### Code Organization
- **Separate concerns** into appropriate packages
- **Use dependency injection** where appropriate
- **Avoid static state** when possible
- **Handle exceptions** gracefully
- **Log important events** for debugging

### Documentation
- **Comment complex logic** and algorithms
- **Update README** if adding new features
- **Include usage examples** for new functionality
- **Document configuration options**

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- **Test with different fish types** and locations
- **Verify safety features** work correctly
- **Check UI responsiveness** and functionality
- **Test configuration persistence**
- **Validate statistics accuracy**

### Test Scenarios
- **Fresh installation** - First-time user experience
- **Configuration changes** - Settings persistence
- **Error conditions** - Network issues, game updates
- **Long sessions** - Memory usage and stability
- **Safety triggers** - Emergency stops and breaks

### Performance Testing
- **Memory usage** - Monitor for memory leaks
- **CPU usage** - Ensure reasonable resource consumption
- **Response times** - UI should remain responsive
- **Statistics accuracy** - Verify calculations
