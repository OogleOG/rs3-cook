- **Fish Cooked/Burned**: Success and failure counts
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful cooks
- **Experience**: XP gained and XP per hour
- **Banking Trips**: Number of bank visits

### What to Watch For
- **Success Rate**: Should improve as your level increases
- **XP/Hour**: Should be consistent for your fish type
- **Banking Efficiency**: Fewer trips = better efficiency
- **Break Timing**: Regular breaks for safety

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Best Practices

### Essential Safety Tips
1. **Always use breaks**: Enable the break system
2. **Start with short sessions**: 30-60 minutes initially
3. **Monitor regularly**: Check on the script periodically
4. **Use realistic settings**: Don't aim for perfect efficiency
5. **Stay updated**: Keep the script updated

### Break System
- **Default timing**: 30-120 second breaks every 5-15 minutes
- **Randomization**: Timing varies to avoid patterns
- **Manual breaks**: You can trigger breaks manually
- **Activity during breaks**: Script pauses all actions

### Emergency Stops
The script will automatically stop if:
- Your health drops too low
- You enter combat
- Too many failures occur
- Session time limit reached
- Target XP reached

- Is your cooking level high enough?
- Are there any error messages?

### "Banking isn't working"
**Solutions:**

### "High burn rate"
**Solutions:**

## üìà Optimizing Your Experience

### Maximizing XP/Hour
1. **Choose appropriate fish**: Not too easy, not too hard
2. **Use best locations**: Ranges > Bonfires > Fires
3. **Optimize banking**: Use nearest bank or presets
4. **Minimize travel**: Choose locations close to banks

### Maximizing Profit
1. **Check fish prices**: Use GE prices for calculations
2. **Consider burn rates**: Factor in losses from burning
3. **Account for supplies**: Include any additional costs
4. **Monitor market**: Prices change frequently

### Leveling Efficiently
1. **Progress through fish**: Upgrade when burn rate improves
2. **Use bonfires**: 10% XP bonus when available

4. **Complete quests**: Some provide cooking XP rewards

## üéì Advanced Tips
